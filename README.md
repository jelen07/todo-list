# Todo List
> Simple example of REST API application written in PHP using Symfony & API Platform.

## User Story
*As a user, I want to have an ability to see a list of tasks for my day, so that I can do them one by one.*

## Todo
- [x] Install a lightweight version of Symfony `$ symfony new todo-list`
- [x] Install and configure API Platform
- [x] Create an application model
- [x] Set better error messages while authentication - do not expose info, that some user is registered or not
- [ ] Use UUID instead of autoincrement
- [ ] Add fixtures
- [ ] Implement basic functionality (REST back-end)
- [ ] Implement front-end (PHP x Vue.js)
- [ ] Write tests (consider using TDD)
- [ ] Use Docker
- [ ] Update README
- [ ] Go out

### Next
List of changes, that should be done, but they're not implemented due to lack of time. 
- Add coding standard checker + fixer
- Add static analysis tool
- Entities mapping and other configuration should not be tied to the entities - replace annotations with XML definition
- Set up CI&CD process via GitHub Actions
- Implement security especially within API
- ...
